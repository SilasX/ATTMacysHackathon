Made for the [AT&T/Macy's Hackathon](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/att-mobile-app-hackathon-bay-area-tickets-17498130379).

Started with Ansari's [repo](https://github.com/Gamerholic/glams), but making this so that others can reproduce what we set up there.

## Installation

Install [ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/guide/installation.html) per instructions.

Then run from project root directory:

    ionic serve
